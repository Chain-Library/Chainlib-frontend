# ChainLib Documentation
**Empowering Stories, Decentralized Freedom**

**Mission:** Own your stories, engage your readers, and earn from your content with blockchain transparency.

**ChainLib** is a decentralized e-library and NFT-powered publishing platform built to empower writers and readers through blockchain technology. It is being developed **on Starknet**, a Layer 2 ZK-rollup that ensures scalability, transparency, and censorship resistance

ChainLib provides a censorship-resistant, creator-first publishing experience eliminating middlemen, securing digital ownership, and rewarding reader engagement.

ChainLib enables:

* **Authors** to mint books as NFTs, retain creative rights, and earn royalties directly.
* **Readers** to discover unique works, own digital editions, and support authors without intermediaries.
* **All content** to be securely stored using decentralized technologies like **IPFS**, ensuring permanence and accessibility.

Built entirely on **Starknet**, ChainLib benefits from fast, scalable, and secure transactions without compromising decentralization.


## Why ChainLib Exists

The traditional publishing model is riddled with intermediaries, unfair revenue splits, and limited global access. ChainLib exists to:

* Empower writers with full ownership and transparent earnings.
* Provide readers with access to original, verifiable, and collectible digital content.
* Create a fair and direct relationship between authors and readers.
* Preserve cultural content through permanent blockchain storage.
* Make it possible for niche communities to thrive outside of mainstream publishing.
* Reduce censorship and gatekeeping by enabling authors to publish globally without centralized approval.

## Key Features

### Decentralized Storage

Books are all decentralized ensuring they’re censorship-resistant and permanently available. IPFS hash references are embedded in each book’s NFT metadata, guaranteeing integrity and traceability.

### NFT Publishing on Starknet

Every published book is minted as an **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)** using Starknet’s NFT standard. These NFTs are verifiable, collectible, and transferable. Books may include limited editions, token-gated chapters, or bonus content exclusive to holders.

### Cairo Smart Contracts

Royalty distribution, access rights, and ownership are all managed through **Cairo smart contracts** on Starknet, ensuring transparency and eliminating the need for intermediaries. Creators define royalty percentages and resale rights during publication.

### Reader Engagement & Rewards

Readers earn achievements and ranks by reading, reviewing, collecting, and engaging with content. XP points, reading challenges, and review streaks foster community participation and influence visibility.

### Wallet Integration (Starknet Wallets)

ChainLib supports **Starknet-compatible wallets** such as **Argent X** and **Braavos**, enabling easy onboarding and secure authentication. Wallet login unlocks book purchases, airdrops, and access to private author-reader experiences.

### Secondary Markets

ChainLib NFTs can be listed on emerging Starknet NFT marketplaces. Resale royalties are enforced via ChainLib’s smart contracts.

Each author and reader profile is bound to a smart contract wallet, enabling portable reputation and composable identity across the Starknet ecosystem.
